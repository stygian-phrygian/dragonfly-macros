# Dragonfly Macros
A set of macros to assist coding by voice.
The macros work with the [dragonfly library](
  http://dragonfly.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

### Installation
Assuming you hiked the mountain of pain that is [setting up the dragonfly library](https://github.com/simianhacker/code-by-voice#getting-started), simply place all the python files from the grammars directory into the windows MacroSystem directory (which is presumably located at C:\\Natlink\Natlink\Macrosystem).

### Issues
Nota Bene: This is a work in progress.  
Consider the code a starting ground for your own macros.
